0,20655415.0,"Fat-reduced cheeses often suffer from undesirable texture, flavor, and cooking properties. Exopolysaccharides (EPS) produced by starter strains have been proposed as a mechanism to increase yield and to improve the texture and cooking properties of reduced-fat cheeses. The objective of this work was to assess the influence of an exopolysaccharide on the yield, texture, cooking properties, and quality of half-fat Cheddar cheese. Two pilot-scale half-fat Cheddar cheeses were manufactured using single starters of an isogenic strain of Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris (DPC6532 and DPC6533) that differed in their ability to produce exopolysaccharide. Consequently, any differences detected between the cheeses were attributed to the presence of the exopolysaccharide. The results indicated that cheeses made with the exopolysaccharide-producing starter had an 8.17% increase in actual cheese yield (per 100 kg of milk), a 9.49% increase in moisture content, increase in water activity and water desorption rate at relative humidities <or=90%, significant differences in the cheeses microstructure, and a significant improvement in both textural and cooking properties, without negatively affecting the flavor profiles of the cheeses.",Journal of dairy science,"['D000818', 'D002611', 'D055598', 'D005223', 'D005516', 'D005524', 'D013294', 'D010865', 'D011135']","['Animals', 'Cheese', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Fats', 'Food Microbiology', 'Food Technology', 'Lactococcus lactis', 'Pilot Projects', 'Polysaccharides, Bacterial']",Effect of exopolysaccharide produced by isogenic strains of Lactococcus lactis on half-fat Cheddar cheese.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20655415,2010

The birds were randomly allocated into 4 treatments, of which dietary fiber was mainly from corn straw silage (CSS), steam-exploded corn straw (SECS), steam-exploded wheat straw (SEWS), and steam-exploded rice straw (SERS). No influence (P>0.05) on the basic chemical components, oxidative stability, or organoleptic traits of muscle were observed, except that birds fed SECS had a higher (P<0.05) protein proportion than those fed CSS or SERS, and CSS increased (P<0.01) the cholesterol content when compared to SEWS or SERS. Regarding fatty acid profile in meat, CSS and SECS increased (P<0.01) the proportion of C18:2n6t and decreased that of C21:0 and C22:0 when compared to the others. The birds fed SERS had a higher (P<0.05) proportion of C20:0 and C22:0 than the others, a higher proportion of C20:5n3, n-3 fatty acids, Î”-9 desaturase (18) index compared to those fed CSS or SECS, and a lower (P<0.01) proportion of C20:1n9 than those fed SECS or SEWS.

8,25351874.0,"It is a well-known fact that amines are not stable in food of a fatty nature. In this study the synthesis and characterisation of the products obtained as a result of the reaction of amines in a fatty medium are reported. Based on the well-known reactions among amines and acid and esters groups, two novel compounds were synthesised using m-xylylenediamine (mXDA), a primary diamine widely used as monomer in the manufacture of food contact materials and two fatty acids, oleic acid and palmitic acid, which occur in most fats. The resulting compounds were two molecules belonging to the family of fatty acid amides, dioleamide and dipalmitamide. A complete characterisation of both products was carried out employing several techniques such as infrared spectroscopy, (1)H- and (13)C-NMR spectroscopy, electron ionisation mass spectrometry, LC-MS/MS and UV spectrometry. The results obtained by the different techniques were well correlated. In the second part of the work, the formation of these compounds in real samples was evaluated. For this purpose a certain volume of olive oil was spiked with a known amount of mXDA. Olive oil was selected as a fatty medium since it is a widely consumed food and additionally is used as a fatty food simulant in migration studies of food contact materials. A method was developed to extract the fatty acid amides from the fatty matrix, which were then identified by LC-MS/MS. The toxicity of the synthesised compounds was predicted using a toxicity estimation software tool. ","Food additives & contaminants.

9,19789907.0,"Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), such as hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), are ubiquitous anthropogenic environmental contaminants. They are persistent, broad-spectrum toxicants that accumulate in the food web with potential risks to the ecosystem and human health. HCHs were the predominant contaminants in Baiyangdian Lake, North China. Concentrations of HCHs and DDTs ranged from 58 to 563 ng/g lipid weight (lw) and 21 to 401 ng/g lw, respectively, for aquatic biota samples. The highest levels of HCHs and DDTs were observed in muscles of yellow catfish. The mean concentrations of OCPs were 4.6 ng/L for water, 95 ng/g dry weight (dw) for aquatic plants, and 14 ng/g dw for sediments. Among the isomers and metabolites, alpha-HCH and p,p'-1,1-di(p-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) were the predominant congeners in biota samples. Correlations between log lipid-normalized concentrations of HCHs and DDTs and trophic levels (TLs) based on analysis of stable isotopes of nitrogen confirmed that persistent organic pollutants were magnified in the Baiyangdian Lake food web. Significant positive relationships were found for alpha-HCH and p,p'-DDT and their trophic magnification factors, which were 1.6 and 1.7, respectively.

15,11513672.0,"Knowledge of the kinetics and pathways of hydrolytic degradation is crucial to the prediction of the fate and transport mechanism of chemicals. This work first describes the kinetics of the chemical hydrolysis of imazosulfuron, a new sulfonylurea herbicide, and evaluates the results to propose a degradation pathway. The hydrolysis of imazosulfuron has been studied in aqueous buffers both within the pH range 1.9-12.3 at ambient temperature (thermostated at 25 +/- 2 degrees C) and at pH 3.6 within the temperature range of 15-55 degrees C. The hydrolysis rate of imazosulfuron was characterized by a first-order kinetics, pH- and temperature-dependent, and accelerated by acidic conditions and higher temperatures. The calculated half-lives at pH 4.5 and 5.9 were 36.5 and 578 days, respectively. At pH 6.6, 7.4, 9.2, and 12.3 no significant change in imazosulfuron concentration was observed after 150 days. Half-lives were much lower at pH <4 (= imazosulfuron pK(a)), at which they ranged from 3.3 to 6.3 days. Moreover, a change in temperature from 15 to 25 degrees C in acidic conditions (pH 3.6) decreased the half-life of imazosulfuron by a factor of approximately 4.0; in any case, a 3-5-fold increase in the rate of hydrolysis was found for each 10 degrees C increase in temperature.

16,24863435.0,"Abscisic acid (ABA) plays a crucial role in the plant's response to both biotic and abiotic stress. Sustainable production of food faces several key challenges, particularly the generation of new varieties with improved water use efficiency and drought tolerance. Different studies have shown the potential applications of Arabidopsis PYR/PYL/RCAR ABA receptors to enhance plant drought resistance. Consequently the functional characterization of orthologous genes in crops holds promise for agriculture. The full set of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) PYR/PYL/RCAR ABA receptors have been identified here. From the 15 putative tomato ABA receptors, 14 of them could be grouped in three subfamilies that correlated well with corresponding Arabidopsis subfamilies. High levels of expression of PYR/PYL/RCAR genes was found in tomato root, and some genes showed predominant expression in leaf and fruit tissues. Functional characterization of tomato receptors was performed through interaction assays with Arabidopsis and tomato clade A protein phosphatase type 2Cs (PP2Cs) as well as phosphatase inhibition studies. Tomato receptors were able to inhibit the activity of clade A PP2Cs differentially in an ABA-dependent manner, and at least three receptors were sensitive to the ABA agonist quinabactin, which inhibited tomato seed germination. Indeed, the chemical activation of ABA signalling induced by quinabactin was able to activate stress-responsive genes. Both dimeric and monomeric tomato receptors were functional in Arabidopsis plant cells, but only overexpression of monomeric-type receptors conferred enhanced drought resistance. In summary, gene expression analyses, and chemical and transgenic approaches revealed distinct properties of tomato PYR/PYL/RCAR ABA receptors that might have biotechnological implications.

17,31148101.0,"Information about novel environments or foods can be gathered via individual or social learning. Whereas individual learning is assumed to be more costly and less effective than social learning, it also yields more detailed information. Juveniles are often found to be more explorative than adults. Still under the protection of their parents, this allows them to sample their environment in preparation for later in life. We tested individual and social learning in jackdaws (Corvus monedula) of different age groups in a semi-natural group setting. Juvenile and adult jackdaws differed in their learning propensity. Juveniles spent more time at the test apparatus, were more explorative, and caused the apparatus to open. Almost all the openings at the apparatus matched the demonstrated method. As more observers became available, the juveniles could observe each other. Individuals preferentially watched successful conspecifics and those they could scrounge food from. Lower-ranking individuals tended to watch higher ranking ones; higher ranking individuals preferentially watched conspecifics of similar rank. The control group did not manipulate the apparatus. Due to the lack of this baseline, it was difficult to determine for certain whether the opening technique was acquired via individual or social learning. We conclude that if social learning played a role, the underlying mechanism was most likely local or stimulus enhancement.

18,18780242.0,"The essential oil and the volatile compounds of Myrica gale fruits were analysed by gas chromatography (GC) and GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The volatile compounds were detected using two different fibres for headspace-solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME), Carboxen/PDMS and PDMS. Sixty two compounds were identified, which represented more than 90% of the total extracts. Major components of fruit essential oil are alpha-pinene (22.6%), 1,8-cineole (18.9%) and germacrone (14.2%), whereas they are germacrone (25.1%), alpha-pinene (12.2%), limonene (8.1%) and alpha-phellandrene (8.0%) for the leaf essential oil. Major volatile fruit compounds detected in HS-SPME were alpha-pinene, 1,8-cineole, p-cymene and eth-cadinene. As M. gale fruits are traditionally used in brewery for flavouring beer or as a spice in soups or stews, the antifungal properties of these essential oils were investigated on a panel of foodborne fungi, namely Aspergillus flavus, Cladosporium cladosporioides and Penicillium expansum. A complete antifungal activity was observed at 1000 ppm against C. cladosporioides. Both essential oil and entire fruits could thus be used as an additive in food or cosmetic preparations for their flavour, odour and their conservative properties.",Natural product research,"['D000935', 'D005658', 'D008401', 'D008826', 'D031641', 'D009822', 'D013045']","['Antifungal Agents', 'Fungi', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Myrica', 'Oils, Volatile', 'Species Specificity']",Chemical composition of essential oil and headspace-solid microextracts from fruits of Myrica gale L. and antifungal activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18780242,2008
